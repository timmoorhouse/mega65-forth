# MEGA65 Forth (MEGA654<sup>th</sup>?)

An attempt at [Forth](https://forth-standard.org/standard/words) for the [MEGA65](https://mega65.org/).  This is heavily influenced by [FIG FORTH release 1.1](https://github.com/ptorric/figforth)

Note that we have actually switched to font A (the ASCII font).  The `\` word shows up correctly on screen but the screenshot from m65 assumes the default font.

This is still in the early stages of developement:

- The interpreter is working well enough to support development.  It needs better error handling, etc.
- File input is mostly functional but slow.  Improving I/O speed likely won't be a priority until I can get more of the test suite passing and automated.
- Words can be defined (`:`, `;`, `CREATE`, `VARIABLE`, `CONSTANT`, etc are functional).  Many of the basic control structures are working (`IF`/`ELSE`/`THEN`, `BEGIN`/`AGAIN`, etc). Check the status table below.
- The [preliminary](https://github.com/gerryjackson/forth2012-test-suite/blob/master/src/prelimtest.fth) test case runs mostly clean.  There's one minor problem caused by a PETSCII vs ASCII difference.

The next priorities are:
- Getting the [core](https://github.com/gerryjackson/forth2012-test-suite/blob/master/src/core.fr) test results cleaned up.  This is coming along nicely but there are still a number of things in CORE to implement and some known bugs.
- As more and more of the implementation moves to Forth, getting a functional `SEE` would be very helpful.  Even if it's just a hex dump at first, getting something in place might soon be a priority.
- Once `DEFER` is implemented, we might be able to move many parts of the outer interpreter from assembler to Forth.

My apologies if this isn't the greatest Forth implementation.  I don't really have much experience with Forth.  I'm doing this because I've always been intrigued by Forth, and with a new MEGA65 sitting on the dining room table, it seemed the perfect project to learn about Forth, shake decades of dust off my 6502 programming skills, and learn about some of the MEGA65-specific features.

An attempt will be made to:

- Be more [Forth 2012](http://www.forth200x.org/documents/forth-2012.pdf) compliant, or at least ANS Forth (94).  Things that have been removed in 2012 (such as `TIB`) almost certainly won't be implemented.  Things that are obsolescent in 2012 (such as `[COMPILE]`) may not be implemented either.
- Provide access to MEGA65 features.  I'll likely look at least at SUPER FORTH 64 (which was based on MVP-FORTH) for API ideas here, and possibly others, but I may not retain compatability.

I haven't looked at geoForth yet, but intend to at some point.  Making some sort of equivalent for the MEGA65 GEOS might be interesting, and give me an excuse to dig into GEOS a bit.  No promises here though.

# BUILDING

## Requirements

- [Acme](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass):  I was using the one from [MEGA65 github](https://github.com/MEGA65/acme) but switched to the svn version to get access to some of the more recent features, but I'm not certain I ended up using them.  It could be that the MEGA65 one will still work.

There is a build script in `bin/build.sh` that can be used.  Right now it doesn't do a huge amount, but eventually I expect
that the build process will get more involved:

- Compiling the builtins
- Use a MEGA65 or xemu to compile the rest of the standard dictionary, possibly for multiple configurations (a minimal set, a complete set, etc)
- Run a test suite
- Run benchmarks
- Building tools (an assembler word set? an editor?)
- Assembling a disk image with various build configuration, source code, examples, tools

## Recommendations

- [Vice](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/) for c1541 and petcat to manipulate d81 images
- m65, mega65_ftp from [mega65-tools](https://github.com/MEGA65/mega65-tools)
- [m65dbg](https://github.com/MEGA65/m65dbg)
- [xemu](https://github.com/lgblgblgb/xemu)

# RANDOM TODOs

These should get us to the point of bootstrapping with a dictionary written in forth and running unit tests:
- CORE
  - [ ] #8
  - [ ] `+LOOP` can exit one iteration too early
  - [ ] `UM/MOD` gets things wrong for large inputs
  - [ ] Handle `RESTORE-INPUT` failures
  - [ ] Need to replace `.` with the one that handles different bases, signed values, etc
  - [ ] Need to reimplement the multiplication/division operations using the math unit
- CORE-EXT
- DOUBLE
  - [ ] Need to support double literals (eg `123.`)
- FILE
  - [ ] Handle file access modes
  - [ ] Fix I/O status handling (when is status from READSS reset?)
  - [ ] Fix handling of I/O error cases
- SEARCH
  - [ ] Honour the hidden flag in `SEARCH-NAMELIST` (or in `TRAVERSE-WORDLIST`?)
- Bootstrapping with portions of the dictionary written in Forth
  - [ ] A "skeletal" configuration with just the builtins
  - [ ] A "minimal" configuration
  - [ ] A "complete" configuration
  - [ ] Move things we can from assembler to Forth
- Error checking
  - [ ] Data stack overflow/underflow
  - [ ] Return stack overflow/underflow
  - [ ] `ALLOT` overflow/underflow
  - [ ] Mismatched control structures
- Making `SAVESYSTEM` output deterministic? (it might not make sense to do this)
  - [ ] Move basepage to top of memory?
  - [ ] What to do about DMA lists?
- Tests
  - [ ] [Test suite](https://github.com/gerryjackson/forth2012-test-suite)
  - [ ] Some reasonable way of capturing test results 
    - It might make sense to have a way to redirect `EMIT` to a file (this would need to persist across an `ABORT` though, so may need a compilation option)   gforth makes `EMIT` a deferred, which might be the cleanest option (once we support `DEFER`).
- Benchmarks
  - [ ] Compiling the dictionary?
  - [ ] Something without I/O?
  - [ ] A naive fibonnaci might be nice for inner interpreter performance

There'll be lots more to do after that.

# STATUS

Note that some of these are implemented in Forth and the bootstrap process is not yet automated.

# TEST STATUS

The code is getting to the point where automating the test suite makes sense.  I do want to have some way to redirect output to make extracting results simpler.

Test | Status | Comments
:-- | :--: | :--
[Preliminaries](https://github.com/gerryjackson/forth2012-test-suite/blob/master/src/prelimtest.fth) | PASS | `[CHAR] A` complains about a PETSCII vs ASCII difference.
